GeoTiff file format is a public domain metadata standard which allows georeferencing information to be embedded within a TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) file. TIFF is a widely accepted versatile raster data format and is a standard image file format for GIS applications.

The python GDAL package is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats, and it includes a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing too. User can download the python package from 
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL

In this script, we use the python GDAL package to read and plot a GeoTiff file download from the LP DAAC Global Data Explorer (USGS) ( http://gdex.cr.usgs.gov/gdex/).
